# Allow-list and helpers for the OSS Index dependency audit in
# test-security.R. The list lives here rather than in the test file because
# both test blocks read it -- the offline well-formedness check and the
# network audit itself.
#
# Narrowing the audit to hard dependencies cleared five of the seven repos in
# this fleet. It does NOT clear robotstxtr: `curl` is a genuine hard
# dependency here, reached through httr2. The two advisories below name
# libcurl version ranges that include CRAN's current `curl` 8.0.0, so there is
# no version to upgrade to and no local change that makes the audit clean.
# Suppressing the whole gate to get past them would retire it for every OTHER
# dependency too, so each advisory is allow-listed BY ID with the reason it is
# permitted (ROBO-oykjiyjj, deciding SEOR-feqgnbwt route (a)).
#
# Three rules keep the list honest. test-security.R enforces them:
#
#   A  UNEXPECTED  an advisory reported and not allow-listed FAILS. This is
#                  the gate still doing its job: a new vulnerability in httr2,
#                  rurl or anything else stops the push.
#   B  STALE       an allow-listed advisory NO LONGER reported FAILS. An
#                  allow-list may not over-permit; a row that has outlived its
#                  justification is deleted, not left to widen the exemption
#                  silently. Same rule as C0 in rurl's tools/curl-zero-gate.R.
#   C  DRIFT       past its review date, or audited at a package version later
#                  than `version_seen`, a row WARNS. Deliberately not a
#                  failure: a calendar date that turns every push red is how a
#                  gate teaches people to reach for --no-verify. The warning
#                  is visible in the testthat summary and in CI logs.
#
# Adding a row is a decision, not a formality. Rule B is what keeps it one.
