# OSV (Open Source Vulnerabilities) audit of robotstxtr's runtime dependencies.
#
# Companion to the OSS Index audit (test-security.R), but with no account or
# token: OSV is free, unauthenticated, and has first-class CRAN coverage (the
# RSEC / R Consortium advisory feed). This checks robotstxtr's *runtime*
# dependency closure -- the recursive Depends + Imports that actually ship to
# users, not dev/Suggests packages -- at their installed versions, via {rosv}.
#
# `rosv::osv_query()` is version-aware: for a given (package, version) it
# returns zero rows when that version is unaffected, so a non-empty result is
# a genuine advisory against the installed version. It is a network test, so
# it skips on CRAN, offline, or when rosv is not installed. The dedicated
# osv-audit.yml workflow runs it (weekly + on demand) to drive the README
# badge; everywhere else it skips cleanly.
