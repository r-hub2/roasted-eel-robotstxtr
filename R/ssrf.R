# Structural SSRF guard for the robots.txt fetch policy (ROBO-quovenef).
#
# Ported from sitemapr's ADR-003 structural SSRF guard; keep the two matchers in
# sync. Pure, side-effect-free, no-network, no-DNS: the fetch engine calls it
# once per redirect hop on each URL before issuing a request. It does range and
# pattern matching on host/scheme components; it never resolves DNS or opens a
# socket. The reason codes returned are machine-readable and stable:
#   "loopback", "private", "link-local", "cloud-metadata", "shared",
#   "unspecified", "this-network", "ipv4-mapped", "ipv4-translated",
#   "ipv4-compatible", "nat64", "6to4", "teredo", "isatap",
#   "malformed-address", "numeric-literal", "scheme"; NA when allowed.
#
# "shared" and "this-network" replaced two inherited misnomers: CGNAT space was
# reported as "cloud-metadata", and all of 0.0.0.0/8 as "unspecified" when only
# 0.0.0.0/32 is. Neither the blocked set nor the posture changed — both blocks
# stay blocked — only the label. Corrected here rather than propagated into
# ssrfr, whose spec (ssrfr-v1.md §6.3) names both as misnomers to fix
# deliberately.
#
# IPv6->IPv4 embedding. Several IPv6 spellings embed a 32-bit IPv4 address; left
# undecoded each is a bypass of the IPv4 range checks. We decode all of them and
# re-run the IPv4 classifier on the embedded address (a PUBLIC embedded address
# is still allowed — only blocked v4 ranges are rejected):
#   prefix             form             reason code
#   ::ffff:0:0/96      IPv4-mapped      "ipv4-mapped"
#   ::ffff:0:0:0/96    IPv4-translated  "ipv4-translated"
#   ::/96              IPv4-compatible  "ipv4-compatible" (deprecated SIIT)
#   64:ff9b::/96       NAT64 well-known "nat64"
#   64:ff9b:1::/48     NAT64 local-use  "nat64" (RFC 6052 §2.2 packing)
#   2002::/16          6to4             "6to4"   (IPv4 at bits 16-47)
#   2001::/32          Teredo           "teredo" (low 32 bits, XOR 0xffffffff)
#   any prefix         ISATAP           "isatap" (IPv4 after a *:5efe marker)
# The last three are IPv6 TRANSITION mechanisms: they embed the IPv4 address
# somewhere other than the low 32 bits, so a decoder that only reads the tail
# misses them entirely (ROBO-laydgesq). DNS resolve-then-check and arbitrary
# (deployment-configured) NAT64 prefixes remain out of scope (matching sitemapr
# ADR-003 §1).
#
# POSTURE — malformed IPv6 literals FAIL CLOSED. Every IPv6 rule reads the
# expanded hextets, so a literal ssrf_ipv6_hextets() cannot resolve to exactly 8
# hextets ("fe80:::1", "::12345", "::ffff:999.1.1.1") is not an address this
# guard can reason about. It is refused with "malformed-address" rather than
# reaching the default allow (ROBO-udnyuuwn, mirrored as sitemapr
# SITE-zgufvkks). Such a literal is unreachable through the real fetch path —
# rurl rejects it before the guard sees it — but the guard no longer depends on
# that, which is the reliance ROBO-pzgzxkoj set out to remove. Because the
# classifier refuses up front, the rules below may assume 8 numeric hextets.
